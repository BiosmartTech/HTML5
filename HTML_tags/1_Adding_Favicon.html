      <h2>What is the size of a favicon?</h2>
      <p>
        Modern web browsers are flexible with sizing of your favicon, but they typically prefer 32x32 and 16x16 pixel
        favicons. For less commonly used web browsers the sizing varies. You can use the favicon generator to create a
        1024x1024 pixel image if you need to create additional sizes.
